#	X86 Assembly Language

#	Opcodes and Instructions

##	There are 3 categories of instructions:

	1. Data Movement / Access
	2. Arithmetic / Logic
	3. Conntrol Flow

##	Common Instruction

	* mov, lea (data movement, data access)

	* add, sub (arithmentic)

	* or, and, xor (logic)

	* shr, shl (logic)

	* ror, rol (logic)

	* jmp, jne, jnz, jnb (control flow)

	* push, pop, call, leave, enter, ret (control flow)


Example : 

Instruciton : mov ecx,[0xaaaaaaaa];
Opcode : 8B 0D AA AA AA AA

#	Registers

##	Genreal Purpose Registers.

	* Register  Description

	* EAX  Accumulator Register

	* EBX	 Base Register

	* ECX  Counter Register

	* EDX  Data Register

	* ESI  Source Index

	* EDI  Destination Index

	* EBP  Base Pointer
 
	* ESP  Stack Pointer

##	Instruction Pointer

The EIP register contais the address of the next instruction to be executed.

##	Segment Registers

Register  Description

	* SS  Stack Segment, Pointer to the stack

	* CS  Code Segment, Pointer to the code

	* DS  Data Segment, Pointer to the data

	* ES  Extra Segment, Pointer to extra data

	* FS  F Segment, Pointer to more extra data

	* GS  G Segment, Pointer to still more extra data

##	EFLAGS Registers

ID 		Name 					Description 		

CF		Carry flag 				Set if the last arithmetic operation carried (addition) or borrowed (subtraction) a bit beyond the size of the register. This is then checked when the operation is followed 								 with an add-with-carry or subtract-with-borrow to deal with values too large for just one register to contain

PF 		Parity flag 			Set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte is a multiple of 2

AF		Adjust flag 			Carry of Binary Code Decimal (BCD) numbers arithmetic operations

ZF 		Zero Flag 				Set if the result of an operation is Zero (0)

SF 		Sign flag 				Set if the result of an operation is negative

TF 		Trap Flag 				Set if step by step debugging

IF 		Interruption Flag 		Set if interrupts are enabled

DF 		Direction Flag 			Stream direction. If set, string operations will decrement their pointer rather than incrementing it, reading memory backwards

OF 		Overflow Flag 			Set if signed arithmetic operations result in a value too large for the register to contain

IOPL 	I/O Privilege Level		I/O Privilege Level of the current process 
		field (2 bits)
	
NT 		Nested Task Flag 		Controls chaining of interrupts. Set if the current process is linked to the next process

RF 		Resume Flag  			Response to debug exceptions

VM 		Virtual-8086 Mode  		Set if in 8086 compatibility mode

AC  	Alignment Check 		Set if alignment checking of memory references is done

VIF 	Virtual Interrupt Flag  Virtual image of IF

VIP 	Virtual Interrupt   	Set if an interrupt is pending
		Pending flag

ID 		Identification Flag 	Support for CPUID instruction if can be set
